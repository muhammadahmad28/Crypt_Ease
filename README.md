CryptEase is a Python-based encryption utility designed to provide secure and efficient encryption and decryption for files. The project offers a simple command-line interface (CLI) for tasks such as key generation, file encryption, and file decryption.

---

## Features

- **Secure File Encryption**: Uses AES and RSA algorithms to ensure data security.
- **Key Generation**: Generates cryptographic keys.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A straightforward and user-friendly interface for performing encryption and decryption tasks.

---

## Motivation

The goal of CryptEase is to make file encryption accessible and straightforward for users who value their privacy. This project demonstrates practical applications of cryptographic principles and showcases Python's capabilities in implementing secure algorithms.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Cryptographic Libraries**: `cryptography` for AES and RSA implementation

---

## Installation

To use CryptEase locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdur-Rehman-Rehan/crypt_ease.git
   cd cryptease
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python cryptease.py
   ```

## How to Use

Run the application and guided mode will start it will give you options to chose from. You can select what task you want to perform and follow the steps like setting output folder, giving name, adding password etc.

## ToDo List

Future improvements and planned features for CryptEase include:

- Argument-Based Execution: Add support for running the program using command-line arguments.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI version for users who prefer visual interfaces.
- Additional Algorithm Support: Extend functionality to include more encryption algorithms.
- Bug Fixes: Address minor errors and enhance overall stability.
